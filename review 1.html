	<center><h2>The Conjuring</h2></center>
<p>The Conjuring is a horror film loosely based off of paranomal investigators, Ed and Lorraine's experiences. In this film, it begins with a story about Annabelle, another reoccurring entity and a notorious one both in real life and in film, there are people sitting on the couch talking about their experience with her and how scared they were. After this, Ed and Lorraine visit a home infested with an otherwordly demon that makes itself known through haunting the Perron family who were living there. Eventually, things begin to escalate and as things get worse with the mother eventually getting possessed, the more Ed and Lorraine discover about the house and its history.</p>
	<p>This is the first movie out of a very long movie series which features other famous works such as Annabelle, The Nun, etc.</p>

			<center><h2>My Personal Review</h2></center>
<p>I enjoyed this movie, however, I found it to be lacking at times and occasionally found it difficult to understand what was happening. In my opinion,
			this series as a whole progressively got worse and worse each movie with this conjuring being the best as it had a decent storyline while also not overusing jumpscares to elicit fear. I did enjoy the overall plot though and found it to be interesting. However, I found the movie itself to be weak at times.</p>
