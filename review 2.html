	<center><h2>Scott Pilgrim vs The World</h2></center>
<p>Scott Pilgrim vs The World is a film about a man called Scott who falls in love with someone at a mysterious girl at a party named Ramona Flowers, eventually they begin to date and in order to stay with her he has to defeat her "7 Evil Exes". Scott then embarks on a journey to defeat said exes who are all seemingly much cooler than him. This isn't easy for Scott as both he and Ramona are both horrible people and seem to start conflict between one another every few scenes with Scott cheating on his 17 year old girlfriend for Ramona and Flowers neglecting to tell him the truth about herself and her past. In the end, he wins and defeats all of her exes and wins over Ramona's heart.</p>
	<p>This is a film based off of a series of graphic novels under a similar title.</p>

			<center><h2>My Personal Review</h2></center>
<p>I did enjoy this film and its one of my favourites, however, there are some notably problematic and poor jokes that haven't aged well which is why I didn't rate it as high as I would've without these. I enjoyed the concept of many of the characters having flaws (Ramona and Scott's being the most obvious as they often make mistakes) while still being likeable as it brought out a new side of these characters. I also enjoyed the older video game style of editing and found the plot itself to be enjoyable, however, I do dislike Scott a lot as he makes for not only a boring protagonist, but an obnoxious one at that which may put some people off. The side characters are also quite loveable with characters like Envy Adams, Knives, and Kim Pines truly winning over most peoples' hearts.</p>
