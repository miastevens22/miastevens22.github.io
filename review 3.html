			   <center><h2>Legally Blonde</h2></center>
<p>Legally Blonde is a cult classic film about a girl called Elle Woods who gets into harvard law school in order to chase her dreams.. Her dreams being a man called Warner who dumped her when she was expecting a proposal. While at Harvard however, she discovers her true passion for law and instead becomes a highly successful lawyer. This, however, wasn't easy for her due to her previously being a fashion major and being stereotypically feminine, leading to much misogyny coming her way.</p>

			   <center><h2>My Personal Review</h2></center>
			   <p>This is a film that practically anyone can enjoy. It's lighthearted while also talking about how problematic it can be to underestimate somebody based off of stereotypes. Elle is very loveable and we root for her in the entirety of the film even when she makes a wrong move or could be seen as annoying. The most iconic scene, the trial scene, is incredible and gives you a rush of adrenaline while watching. She is also quite inspirational as it's rare to see someone portrayed as very feminine and liking pink while also being smart and a lawyer.</p>
